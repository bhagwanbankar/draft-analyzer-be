<h1 class="section-title">About the Draft Policy Analyser</h1>

<p>
    At Civis, we believe that laws should be shaped by the voices of the people they impact.
    With experience analyzing over <strong>1000+ laws and collaborating with 27 government bodies</strong>, 
    we have seen that public consultations work best when <strong>draft policies</strong> are clear, well-structured, 
    and truly open to feedback. However, many policies fail to meet these standards—lacking justification, accessibility, 
    or meaningful avenues for public participation.
</p>

<p>
    The Draft Policy Analyser ensures that policies going out for consultation meet global best practices.
    It evaluates clarity, justification, impact assessment, and public participation, identifying gaps and offering
    concrete recommendations to improve the draft before it reaches the public. This helps governments build trust,
    increase engagement, and create more effective policies.
</p>

<p>
    Our goal is simple: to make public participation the foundation of better lawmaking.
    By ensuring that policies are transparent, inclusive, and backed by strong reasoning,
    we can help create laws that serve people, not just process.
